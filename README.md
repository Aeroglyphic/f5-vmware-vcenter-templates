# Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for F5's VMware templates for deploying F5 instances in the VMware vCenter Manager. All of the templates in this repository have been developed by F5 Networks engineers. Across all branches in this repository, there are two directories: **supported** and **experimental**. Using Node.js, these templates use vCenters rest API to deploy and configure F5 BIG-IP virtual machines.

  - **supported**<br>
  The *supported* directory contains VMware templates that have been created and fully tested by F5 Networks. These templates are fully supported by F5, meaning you can get assistance if necessary from F5 Technical Support.

  - **experimental**<br>
  The *experimental* directory also contains VMware templates that have been created by F5 Networks. However, these templates have not completed full testing and are subject to change. F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory, so use these templates with caution.

## Template information
Descriptions for each template, including how the templates are generated and assistance in deploying a template,
are contained in the README file on the individual template pages.
### Matrix for tagged releases
F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 VMware vCenter Manager Templates, and the
corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughput levels available for a specific tagged release. See
https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-vmware-vcenter-templates/blob/master/vmware-bigip-version-matrix.md.
## CVE-2017-6168 information
If you have launched an F5 CFT template from a prior release, see the <a href="#important">important note</a> at the
bottom of this page.
## Current F5 VMware vCenter Manager Templates

The following is a list of the current *supported* F5 VMware vCenter Manager Templates. Click the link to view the README file which includes information on how to deploy the template in F5 VMware vCenter Manager.

**Deploying the BIG-IP in VMware vCenter - 1-4 NIC (nNIC)**
- <a href="https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-vmware-vcenter-templates/tree/master/supported/standalone/n-nic/existing-stack">**BYOL or BIG-IQ**</a> (bring your own license), which allows you to use an existing BIG-IP license or use BIG-IQ License Manager.

**Deploying the BIG-IP in VMware vCenter - 4 NIC HA failover**
- <a href="https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-vmware-vcenter-templates/tree/master/supported/failover/same-net/traditional/4nic/existing-stack">**BYOL or BIG-IQ**</a> (bring your own license), which allows you to use an existing BIG-IP license or use BIG-IQ License Manager.
